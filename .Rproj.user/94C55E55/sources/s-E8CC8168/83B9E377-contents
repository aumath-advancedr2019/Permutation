## permutation ()

The permutation function provides a way of easily doing a permutation test of significance between observations of two groups. 

The function provides several number of options for the calculation of the test-statistic, where the most used ones (i.e. difference in mean and difference in median) are easily accessible as options to the argument "test_statistic". Further more a user specified function, "my_method()", can be given as argument to the "test_statitic" option as well, making it very flexible. 

Given observations and information about the group, the function returns a list with a dataframe with the data provided, the method of test-statistic, the function used to calculate the test-statistic, the observed test-statistic, a list with all permuted test-statistics, the permuted p-value and warnings if any.  

The ouput from the function is of class "permutation". On this class both the summary() and plot() functions can be called. 

The output of summary(permutation) yields a print of the most interesting parts of the permutation, e.g. the method used, the observed test-statistic, the permuted p-value and warnings if any. 

The plot(permutation) outputs two plots: 
 
  - One visualizing the raw observations in the two groups together with the wanted test-statistic. 
  - Another visualizing the permuted null-distribution of the test-statistic together with the observed test-statistic. 
  
These two plots helps the user get a better intuition of the permutation output and the resulting p-value. 

## Usage

**Input**

 - `groups`: The column of the dataframe specifying the groups. Must be specified, no default. 
 - `observations`: The column of the dataframe specifying the observations. Must be specified and of equal length as the group column, no default. 
 - `test_statistic`: The method to calculated the test-statistic. Can be one of three options: 
    - `"mean"`: Default. Uses the difference in mean between the two groups to calculate the test-statistic.
    - `"median"`: Uses the difference in median to calculate the test-statistic.
    - `"my_method"`: A user defined function named "my_method()" which takes only one argument, the grouped observations.
 - `nPerm = 10^5`: The number of permutations performed. 

**Output**

A list containing the following: 

 - `data`: At dataframe with the observed data provided by the user. 
 - `Method`: The specified method to calculate the test-statistic. Given by the input `test_statistic`
 - `fun`: The function used to calculate the test-statistic by the method provided.
 - `ObsTeststat`: The observed test-statistic calculated by method given by the input `test_statistic`
 - `PermTestValues`: A list with all the test-statistic values calculated during the permutation. 
 - `PermPvalue`: The permuted p-value. If equal to 0 a warning will be outputted saying: "Warning: nPerm was to low to get any permuted test statistics equal to or more extreme than your observed". 
 - `Warnings`: A string containing a warning if any (else None).

## Example

The BloodPressure dataset provided in the package to try out the permutation function, can be fetched to your local environment by running `data(BloodPressure)`.

**Syntax**

```{r eval = F}
perm <- permutation(group = BloodPressure$Group, observations = BloodPressure$Blood_pressure, 
                    test_statistic = "mean", nPerm = 10^5)
```
