\usage{
permutation(groups, observations, test_statistic = "mean",
  nPerm = 10^5, plot = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{groups}{The column of the datasat containing the two groups. Has to be factors.}

\item{observations}{The column of the dataset containing the observations for the two groups. Has to be numeric.}

\item{test_statistic}{One of 3 options: "mean" (Default), "median" or "my_method". If "my_method", the user has to define a function called "my_method(observations)" that calculates the test-statistic, with the only input being the observations from the data grouped by group.}

\item{nPerm}{Number of permutations. Default is 10^5}

\item{plot}{If TRUE (Default) the function returns two plots together with the regular output. If FALSE no plots are returned.}

\description{
Tool to do a two-sided permutation test on a dataset.
}
\details{
Given a dataset where one column specifies the groups and another column specifies the observed values for each group, the function makes a two-sided permuation test. The teststatistic used for the test can either be mean, median or a user defined method.
}
\examples{

The test data provided in the package, BloodPressure, can be used as following:

permutation(groups = BloodPressure$Groups, observations = BloodPressure$Blood_pressure, test_statistic = "median", n_perm = 10^4, plot = FALSE)

}
