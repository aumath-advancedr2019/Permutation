# Sampling

OBS: The repository on Github is called Permutation but the actually R-Package is called Sampling. 

## Purpose of package
A package for doing permutations and bootstraping easily in R.
This package provide a means for hypothesis testing when the data does not follow the assumtions of parametric test.
A permutation test is done by doing resampling of the observed data without replacement, thereby creating the null-distribution for the association between two variables.
Bootstraping is done by doing resampling of the observed data woth replacement, thereby creating the sampling distribution of a desirered estimate, e.g the difference in mean. From the Sampling distribution, the standart error and confidence intervals are calculated. 



## Functionality
The permutation part of the package returns a plot of the distribution under the null-hypotesis and a p-value.  
The bootstrap will return a blot of the sampling distribution of a given estimate, it's standard error and confidence intervals.
